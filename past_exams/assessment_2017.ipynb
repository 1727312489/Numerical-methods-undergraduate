Please check the instructions carefully and double check that your program fulfils all of the given instructions.\n* Save your work regularly.\n* At the end of the test you should email your IPython notebook document (i.e. this document) to [Gerard Gorman](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.gorman) at <mailto:g.gorman@imperial.ac.uk> **and also** [Matthew Piggott](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.d.piggott) at \n<mailto:m.d.piggott@imperial.ac.uk>  "

Write a Python Gaussian function that takes as input a matrix and returns the upper diagonal matrix. Demonstrate the correctness by applying it to the matrix A. <sub>[17 marks]</sub>\n 2.

Write a function, $f$,  to evaluate this expression for a given $x$. Show that it works by plotting the function with respect to $100$ evenly spaced points between $x=-3$ and $x=3$. <sub>[8 marks]</sub>\n 2. Write another function, $g$ that uses central finite differences to numerically evaluate the derivative of an arbitrary given function with respect to $x$ (you may assume $dx\\approx0.01$). Show that it works by plotting the derivative of the function defined above between $x=-3$ and $x=3$. <sub>[8 marks]</sub>\n 3. Write a function that implements Newton's method for root finding. It should take as input parameters a function, $f$, whose root is to be found, its derivative function, $g$, and an initial guess, $x0$. <sub>[9 marks]</sub>\n 4. Use your implementation of Newton's method to calculate all the roots of $f$ between $-3$ and $3$.<sub>[8 marks]</sub>"
