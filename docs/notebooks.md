Links to the [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) making up this module can be found here: 
[lecture series](http://matt-piggott.github.io/Numerical-methods-undergraduate/lecture_series/).

To run and edit the notebooks yourselves we have two options:

### Azure notebooks

To run the notebooks on the cloud we will be using Micosoft's Azure cloud computing service. For information on this click [here]((https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/overview/what-is-azure/))

To login you can either click on the link to my notebook from the [lecture series](http://matt-piggott.github.io/Numerical-methods-undergraduate/lecture_series/) page. Otherwise you can login to your account at [https://notebooks.azure.com/](https://notebooks.azure.com/). Use your College login credentials (i.e. username@ic.ac.uk).

To get your own working copy of my files right click on my project corresponding to the lecture number and choose 'clone'. It's up to you but I suggest you keep this provate and uncheck the 'public library' button.

At this point you should have your own working copy of the lecture notebooks (the lecture, solutions, and any associated data/images). Youi should see the project under your 'My Projects' page. Locate the approriate 
**.ipynb** file and click on it. You will get a message saying that it's 
spinning up an instance for you so you can execute any code, then a message saying 
it is preparing your container. You should wait until this last message is gone, then you 
will be able to execute your own code just as you did last year.

### Locally using Anaconda
It is also possible to run everything on your desktop/laptop - this is a good fallback option if there is a problem with Azure or you don't have web access. Anaconda should be installed on the departmental machines. To install yourself look at [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and choose Python 3. You can then download the notebooks from Azure, or from the github repo for this module and run them locally.  On Windows, to use Anaconda to run Jupyter notebooks search for 'Jupyter' and click on the 'Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda3)' app.
