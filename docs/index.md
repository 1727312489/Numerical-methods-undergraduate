This is a 2<sup>nd</sup> year undergraduate course for geoscientists taught by [Matthew Piggott](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.d.piggott) 
It is designed to be a first introduction to numerical methods. The [Introduction to Programming for Geoscientists course](http://ggorman.github.io/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/) is a prerequisite to taking this course. You can always click on the [lecture series](http://https://matt-piggott.github.io/Numerical-methods-undergraduate/lecture_series/) to get a complete overview of the topics covered and lecture schedule.

You will learn numerical methods by **doing**. Each lecture will cover:

* theory underlying the numerical methods,
* implementation exercises to help understand the theory,
* programming exercises where you will use Python libraries to apply the methods.


### Jupyer notebook

The lectures notes are written in [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). This is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document. You can refer back to the [previous lecture series](http://ggorman.github.io/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/) for a reminder on how to get started with Jupyternotebook. In particular recall the introductory information given in [lecture 1](http://ggorman.github.io/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/lecture/notes/2018/10/18/Lecture1.html).

### Supplementary material

This course loosely follows the text book ["Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 3" by Jaan Kiusalaas](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/engineering/engineering-mathematics-and-programming/numerical-methods-engineering-python-3-3rd-edition). There are many copies in the library so do not feel that you have to buy it. As explained above, you do not have to read this book to excel in this course as the online course material is self contained. However, it is a good resource if you want to broaden your understanding of the subject.
