This is a vast topic which rapidly becomes somewhat advanced, so we will restrict ourselves here to a very brief introduction to the solution of first order ODEs. A much more comprehensive treatment of this subject is to be found in the Numerical Methods 2 module.\n",

In common with all of the numerical methods we have encountered in this module, our objective will be to find an approximate solution to the ODE at a finite set of points. In this case, we will attempt to find approximate solutions at $t=t_0,t_0+h,t_0+2h,t_0+3h,\\ldots$.\n",

If we actually wish to know the value at some fixed time $T$ then we will have to calculate $(T-t_0)/h$ steps of the method. This sum over $O(1/h)$ steps results in a global truncation error for Euler's method of $O(h)$. In other words, Euler's method is first order.\n",

      "We know, of course, that the solution to this equation is $x=e^t$, but let's ignore that for one moment and evaluate $x(0.1)$ using Euler's method with steps of $0.05$. The first step is:\n",
