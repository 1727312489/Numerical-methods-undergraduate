    "The formula given is used to calculate the value of $x$ one time step forward from the last known value. The error is therefore the local truncation error. If we actually wish to know the value at some fixed time $T$ then we will have to calculate $(T-t_0)/h$ steps of the method. This sum over $O(1/h)$ steps results in a global truncation error for Euler's method of $O(h)$. In other words, Euler's method is first order.\n",
