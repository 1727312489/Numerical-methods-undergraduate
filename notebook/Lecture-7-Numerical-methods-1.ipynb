    "Direct methods perform operations on the linear equations (the matrix system), e.g. the substitution of one equation into another which we performed two weeks ago for your example $2\\times 2$ system considered in MM1. This (and the subsequent Gaussian elimination algorithm) transformed the equations making up the linear system into equivalent ones with the aim of eliminating unknowns from some of the equations and hence allowing for easy solution through back (or forward) substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in MM1 you (may have) learnt Cramer's rule which gives an explicit formula for the inverse of a matrix, or for the solution of a linear matrix system.  It was pointed out that the computational cost (in terms of arithmetic operations required; also termed complexity) scaled like $(n+1)!$, whereas the Gaussian elimination method (which is basically the substitution method descrined above, and implemented over the previous two lectures) scaled like $n^3$.  For large $n$ Gaussian elimination will clearly be more efficient - you considered the case where $n=100$ in MM1 for example. $n$ here refers to the number of unknowns or equations, or sometimes termed the *degrees of freedom* of the problem.\n",

In this case the $n^3$ operations required of a direct algorithm such as Gaussian elimination is completely prohibitive. In an attempt to further reduce this cost *iterative* algorithms were devised.\n",

    "These algorithms start with an initial guess at the solution ($\\pmb{x}_0$), and *iteratively* improve this producing a series of approximate answers $\\pmb{x}_k$. For the *exact* answer to the matrix system $A\\pmb{x} = \\pmb{b}$, we know that the residual vector $\\pmb{r} = A\\pmb{x}-\\pmb{b}$ is zero. For our iterative procedure, we can use the norm of the residual vector $\\pmb{r}_k = A\\pmb{x}_k-\\pmb{b}$ based on the approximate solution $\\pmb{x}_k$, as a measure of how close we are to solving the equation (the norm $\\|\\pmb{r}_k\\|$ expresses this as a single number). As we iterate further, we hope to drive down this number and we may stop the iterations at some small (non-zero) residual norm tolerance level. The final iteration gives us an answer $\\pmb{x}_k$ which is still an approximation to the solution and not the exact solution we would obtain with direct methods.  The residual norm tolerance stopping criteria therefore needs to be thought about carefully, e.g. depending on how accurate a solution $\\pmb{x}$ we require.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we are using updated knowledge immediately, the Gauss-Seidel algorithm should converge faster than Jacobi, but note that this convergence can only be *guaranteed* for matrices which are diagonally dominant (for every row, the magnitude of value on the main diagonal is greater than the sum of the magnitudes of all the other entries in that row), or if the matrix is *symmetric positive definite* (a property we won't define in this course).  \n",

    "## Sparse matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the matrices which result from the numerical solution of differential equations are generally  *sparse* (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix>) which means that most entries are zero (the alternative is termed *dense*).  Knowing which entries are zero means that we can devise more efficient matrix storage methods, as well as more efficient implementations of the above algorithms (e.g. by not bothering to do operations that we know involve multiplications by zero - we know the answer will be zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, for the two iterative methods shown above (Jacobi and Gauss Seidel), the cost of *each* iteration is quadratically dependent on the number of unknowns $n$, since we need to loop through all the entries of the $n\\times n$ matrix $A$. For a fixed number of iterations the computational cost of these methods therefore scales as $n^2$. If we know that each row only contains a fixed, small number of non-zero entries however (as for example the matrix in the example below), we can simply skip the zero entries and the cost *per iteration* becomes linear in $n$. These scalings of $n^2$ for *dense* and $n$ for *sparse* matrices for the cost per iteration are typical for iterative methods. Unfortunately this does not mean that the overall cost of an iterative method is also $n^2$ or $n$, as the number of iterations that is needed to achieve a certain accuracy quite often also increases for larger problem sizes. The number of required iterations typically only increases very slowly however, so that the cost of the method is still considerably cheaper than direct methods, in particular for very large problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A huge range of iterative solution methods exist and the literature on this topic is massive. Below is an example of using scipy to access the Conjugate Gradient algorithm which is a popular example of a method suitable for matrices which result from the numerical solution of differential equations."
